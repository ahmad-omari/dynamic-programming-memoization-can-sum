# Dynamic Programming Memoization "Can Sum"

The function ‘canSum(targetSum, numbers, memo)‘ that takes in a
targetSum of Integer, array of numbers and a memo map as arguments.

* The function returns a boolean indicating whether it is possible to generate the targetSum using numbers from the array.
* Using an element of the array multiple times is allowed. 
* Notice that all input numbers are non-negative numbers.

# Complexity

###Assume that:
#####m = targetSum
#####n = numbers array length
###
####Time Complexity is O( n * m )
####Space Complexity is O( m )
